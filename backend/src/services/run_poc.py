        "INPUT CONTRADICTIONS - Real-world skill progression rules:\n\n"
        "1. SYSTEM DESIGN vs CODING CONTRADICTION:\n"
        "   🚨 IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION: systemDesign='multiple' + problemSolving < '51-100'\n"
        "   Reality: You CANNOT have deep system design expertise without extensive coding practice.\n"
        "   System design requires years of building production systems, which means 100s of problems solved.\n\n"
        "   Resolution Rules:\n"
        "   - If systemDesign='multiple' + problemSolving='0-10' or '11-50' + experience <= '3-5':\n"
        "     → User likely misunderstood questions or is being aspirational\n"
        "     → OVERRIDE: Treat as systemDesign='once' or 'not-yet'\n"
        "     → Recommend Junior/Mid roles (NOT senior)\n"
        "     → In profile_strength_notes: 'Strong interest in system design, but limited coding practice. Focus on solving 100+ problems first.'\n\n"
        "   - If systemDesign='multiple' + problemSolving < '51-100' + experience in ['5-8', '8+'] + currentRole contains 'manager'/'architect':\n"
        "     → Rare case: Transitioned to management/architecture, coding skills atrophied\n"
        "     → Can recommend Architect/Lead roles BUT:\n"
        "     → MUST flag in areas_to_develop: 'Hands-on coding skills - rusty from lack of practice'\n"
        "     → In profile_strength_notes: 'Architecture experience is valuable, but hands-on coding needs refresh for IC roles.'\n\n"
        "   - General rule: NEVER recommend Staff/Principal/Senior SDE if problemSolving < '51-100'\n"
        "     → These roles require deep coding expertise, no exceptions\n\n"
        "2. EXPERIENCE vs SKILLS CONTRADICTION:\n"
        "   - If experience in ['5-8', '8+'] + problemSolving='0-10':\n"
        "     → Likely stuck in maintenance roles or exaggerating experience\n"
        "     → Recommend mid-level roles, NOT senior\n"
        "     → Flag in notes: 'Experience level doesn't match interview preparation. Results may not reflect actual capability.'\n\n"
        "3. PORTFOLIO vs CODING CONTRADICTION:\n"
        "   - If portfolio='active-5+' + problemSolving='0-10':\n"
        "     → Projects likely tutorials/clones, not production-grade\n"
        "     → Good signal for potential, but not for senior roles\n\n"
        "CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR recommended_roles_based_on_interests:\n"
        "1. SENIORITY MATCHING (HIGHEST PRIORITY - NEW 4-TIER SYSTEM):\n"
        "   - 0-2 years → Entry/Junior/SDE-1 roles ONLY\n"
        "   - 3-5 years → Mid-Level/SDE-2/Senior (lower-bound) roles\n"
        "   - 5-8 years → Senior/SDE-3/Staff roles (IF coding skills match - see consistency check)\n"
        "   - 8+ years → Staff/Principal/Lead/Architect roles (IF coding skills match - see consistency check)\n"
        "   - systemDesign='multiple' + problemSolving >= '51-100' + experience in ['5-8', '8+'] → MUST include Staff/Principal/Architect roles\n"
        "   - experience='8+' + strong skills → Prioritize Principal/Architect/Engineering Manager roles\n\n"
        "2. TECHNICAL SKILLS ALIGNMENT:\n"
        "   - problemSolving >= 51-100 + systemDesign != 'not-yet' → PRIORITIZE Engineering roles (Backend/Full Stack/SDE)\n"
        "   - systemDesign='multiple' + problemSolving >= '51-100' → CRITICAL signal for senior technical roles (Staff/Principal)\n"
        "   - systemDesign='multiple' WITHOUT strong coding (< 51-100) → See LOGICAL CONSISTENCY CHECK above - override system design claim\n"
        "   - portfolio='active-5+' → Strong indicator for IC engineering roles\n\n"
        "3. RESPECT TARGET ROLE:\n"
        "   - If targetRole='faang-sde'/'backend'/'fullstack' → Top 3 recommendations MUST be engineering roles\n"
        "   - If targetRole='tech-lead' → Include Lead/Architect roles\n"
        "   - 🔍 CRITICAL: If targetRole='exploring'/'not-sure' OR targetRoleLabel contains 'Exploring':\n"
        "     * User is still deciding their path - PROVIDE SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS!\n"
        "     * Based on their background, experience, skills, and topicOfInterest, suggest 3-5 CONCRETE roles\n"
        "     * DO NOT just echo 'Not sure yet / Exploring' - that's not helpful!\n"
        "     * Example: Non-tech + interested in AI/ML → suggest 'Data Analyst', 'Junior ML Engineer', 'Backend Engineer'\n"
        "     * Example: Tech 0-2 years + web-development interest → suggest 'Junior Frontend Engineer', 'Full-Stack Engineer', 'Backend Engineer'\n"
        "     * Use topicOfInterest as PRIMARY signal when targetRole is exploring\n\n"

        "   ❌ NEVER RECOMMEND NON-TECHNICAL ROLES:\n"
        "   - Product Manager / Product Owner\n"
        "   - UX Designer / UI Designer / Product Designer\n"
